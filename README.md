# CovidFinal

This project is a game called “COVID19-THE FRONTLINE HEROES”. The main idea of the game revolves around rescuing the patients from the corona virus who are in a quarantine environment where people have been infected by this deadly virus and need help. The environment is based on affected areas under lockdown and somewhat abundant due to uncontrollable spread of the virus. The main character is the frontline hero who must rescue patients to a secure zone within a building after finding the patients and asking them to follow him/her. The game starts from a hospital and there are further missions and tasks that need to be completed to exit the hospital and further help the patients. The player upon completing some missions inside the hospital such as getting the access code to open doors, downloading reading research papers of the doctors and scientists, they will search for the patients that need to be treated and are hiding themselves. The player can also face some resistance from the patients. They need to be taken to secure zone for further treatment which also helps in making the vaccine. This game revolves around the frontline heroes who have made efforts to help people.
